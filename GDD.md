## Game Summary

Shadows and Alchemy is a 2D platformer that uses transformations as its main mechanic. The player can transform between two different forms to overcome obstacles and enemies. The game's visual design is based on shadows and darkness, with enemies emitting lights that will damage the player if they remain in them for too long.

## Theme Interpretation

The two themes - shadows and alchemy - have been interpreted and implemented in the following ways:

- Shadows: The game's visual design is based on shadows and darkness. Enemies emit lights that will damage the player if they remain in them for too long.
- Alchemy: The game utilizes Alchemy's definition has Transformation, giving the player the ability to change forms to overcome obstacles that would be impossible to overcome otherwise.

## Story

The game does not have a story.

## Characters

The game features two characters: the unnamed protagonist that tries to escape levels by transforming into different animals and finding the exit portals and a ghostly enemy that emits light to damage the player and stop them from reaching their goal.

## Level Design and Environment Design

The game consists of two levels: a short tutorial level, which teaches the player how to use all of the game's mechanics and a main level, which requires the player to use all mechanics to complete it.
The environment and the protagonist's models have dark tones, reflecting the shadows theme.

## Gameplay

The game features very basic 2D platforming controls, making it very accessible to new players. The player tries to dodge enemies' lights and find exit portals to complete the game. Remaining in the shadows for a couple of seconds while being damaged causes the player to slowly regenerate health. This mechanic allows players that need assistance to take their time and regenerate health before moving on at the cost of a slower completion time.
The game uses semi-randomized exit portal locations and a game over screen features a game completion timer to encourage replayability.

## Art

The game uses a 2D 8x8 pixel tileset for its environment. The character and enemy sprites are dark and have a ghostly appearance. All tilesets, character sprites, animations and background elements were made by myself.

## Sound and Music

I composed the background music and the sound effects using Ableton Live 11. I opted for a darker sound with lots of reverb to match the shadows theme.

## UI

The player's remaining lives are displayed underneath the character's model. The tutorial level uses three sprites that explain to the player how the game's mechanics work. When the game is completed or the player loses all lives, a game over screen including a retry button and a quit button is shown.

## Game Controls

The game is plated with a keyboard. The A and D keys move the player left and right respectively, the space bar allows the player to jump and the enter key lets the player transform between two different forms - one made for fast horizontal movement and one for vertical movement.

## Accessibility

The game features the ability to regenerate health while standing in the shadows, allowing players that need assistance to complete the game, albeit at a slower pace.
